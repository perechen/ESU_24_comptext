Culture &amp; Technology 2024: "Computational text analysis: a survivor guide" 

This repository has slides, scripts and data used through the workshop in Cluj-Napoca, July 15-26, 2024. Will be updated as the work unfolds.

Check the [Computational Stylistics Group website](https://computationalstylistics.github.io/resources/) for more guides, datasets and other information. 

## Technical requirements

- [R language](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
- a simple text reading program (for .txt and .csv) like Sublime Text Editor for Windows, Linux and Mac
- zip/unzip programs (these are programs that you normally have by default in your computer, like 7-Zip or WinZip for Windows, to manage compressed folders)

	- Tuesday. Sorrows of software set-up and introduction to crimes of literary computation
	- Wednesday. Torture of text representations and multidimensional misery
	- Thursday. Unsupervised and network analysis abyss
	- Friday. Classification carnage
	- Saturday. Student hackaton (+ Agony of application)  

- **Week 2: Research workflow**  
	- Monday. Despair of deconstructing the programmatic pipelines
	- Tuesday. Excruciatingly explainable results and features
	- Wednesday. Sampling slaughterhouse and bootstrap bloodbath
	- Thursday. Revenge of replication studies and own projectsâ€™ purgatory
